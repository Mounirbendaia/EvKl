 Or case study is about a venue reservation system where users can reserve their desired venue by entering their names in the text box , we offer 30 venues operating from 8am to 11 pm, and each venue can be reserved for 1 hour. in our system we used the async storage to store the data and to impliment the first come first serve principe we used an if statement to check if the value is null, it means that the venue is not reserved for the requested hour else we have alert that the venue is already reserved
